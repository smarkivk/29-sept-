//The provided Java program uses a for loop to iterate through an ArrayList of strings and print each element. Here's a breakdown of the program:

Import the ArrayList class from the java.util package.

In the main method:

Create an ArrayList named cars to store strings.
Use the add method to add four strings ("Volvo," "BMW," "Ford," and "Mazda") to the cars list.
Use a for loop to iterate through the cars list:

Initialize an integer variable i to 0, which represents the index of the first element in the list.
Set the loop condition to i < cars.size(), which ensures that the loop iterates as long as i is less than the size of the cars list.
In each iteration of the loop, use cars.get(i) to retrieve the element at index i from the cars list.
Print the retrieved element using System.out.println.
